# Semantic JSON Forms

The `<SemanticJSONFormNoOps>` component is a JSON Forms component equipped with special renderers to produce valid JSON-LD documents with
one to many and many to many relationships.

In contrast to `<SemanticJSONForm>`, `<SemanticJSONFormNoOps>` does not have any operations (e.g. create, update, delete), leaving the
implementation of these operations to the user. Nevertheless it is not pure because it still makes use of renderers that use `<SemanticJSONForm>`.

## Exhibition

The following example shows a form rendering an Exhibition of the Exhibition model

<Canvas
  of={SemanticJSONFormNoOpsStories.SemanticJsonFormNoOperationsExhibition}
/>

## Tag

A more basic example is the Tag model

<Canvas of={SemanticJSONFormNoOpsStories.SemanticJsonFormNoOperationsTag} />
